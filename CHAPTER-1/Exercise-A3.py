    EXERCISE A3
    - SOLVE = Show examples of String Concatenation and Replication
                - Show examples of variables assigned to any data type
                - Show examples of overwriting a variable
                - Show examples of variables as expressions
                - Show examples of valid variable names



    VALID VARIABLE NAMES                                INVALID VARIABLE NAMES
    
    current_balance                                     current-balance(hyphens are not allowed)
    
    currentBalance                                      current balance(spaces are not allowed)
    
    account4                                            4account(can't begin with a number)
    
    _42                                                 42(can begin with an underscore but not a number)
    
    TOTAL_SUM                                           TOTAL_$UM(special characters like $ are not allowed)
    
    hello                                               'hello'(special characters like ' are not allowed)

    Variable Names Four Rules:
    - It cant have spaces.
    - It cant use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
    - It cant begin with a number.
    - It cant be a Python keyword, such as if, for, return, or other keywords youll learn in this book.



    - RESOURCES = https://automatetheboringstuff.com/3e/chapter1.html
    - Other possible answers are in the triple quoted ''' ''' comments section below
    - Make sure to exhaust every type of error that these expressions can bring up
    - Be mindful of what data types you are using and what they are not
    - Always explain your code

# Example









# Assigning variables


# Variable Assigned to a string
car = 'ferrari'
print(car)

# Variable Assigned to an integer
year = 2025
print(year)

# Variable Assigned to a boolean
sunny = True
print(sunny)

# Variable Assigned to a floating-point number
electricBillThisMonth = 137.35
print(electricBillThisMonth)









# Overwriting variables

# String overwrite
shoes = 'puma'
print(shoes)
shoes = 'nike'
print(shoes)








# Integer overwrite
weatherOutside = 78
print(weatherOutside)

weatherOutside = 71
print(weatherOutside)

# Boolean overwrite
snowyDay = True
print(snowyDay)

snowyDay = False
print(snowyDay)

# Floating-point number overwrite
footSize = 13.5
print(footSize)

footSize = 12.5
print(footSize)










# Variables as expressions
spam = 52
eggs = 13
print(spam + eggs)
print(spam * eggs)
print(spam / eggs)
print(spam - eggs)






# Valid variable names
bank_balance = 42198709817
greenCar = 'honda'
tshirt3 = True
_87 = 14.16
TOTAL_SUM = bank_balance + _87
aloha = 'Hello!'







# String concatenation and replication

# String concatenation
'Mary' + 'Peterson'

# String replication
'Mary' * 3

# We want to see our values


# String concatenation printed
# Spaces do count
a = 'Mary' + ' Peterson'
print(a)

# String replication printed
b = 'Mary' * 3
print(b)











# Then run the program
